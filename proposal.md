https://github.com/autiehub/final-project

## Description
This project aims to create a 2D platformer game similar to Super Mario Bros., showcasing fundamental game development principles using pygame. It's relevant to media and digital arts by exploring interactive storytelling and visual design

## Features
- Character Movement
	- Implement player controls for moving left, right, and jumping, utilizing keyboard inputs to control the character's actions
- Level Design
	- Create multiple levels with varying obstacles, platforms, and enemies using tilesets to enhance the visual experience
- Collectibles and Scoring System 
	- Introduce coins and power-ups that the player can collect to increase their score and enhance gameplay

## Challenges
- Researching and implementing physics for jumping and gravity to create realistic character movements
- Learning how to design engaging levels that maintain player interest and progressively increase difficulty
- Understanding sound integration in pygame for enhancing the gaming experience through background music and sound effects

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Fully functional platformer game with polished graphics, smooth gameplay, and engaging level, allowing players to enjoy a nostalgic gaming experience

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Single playable level with basic character movement, simple collision detection, and at least one collectible item

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Set up the project structure and install required libraries (pygame, pillow)
  2. Implement basic character movement and screen boundaries

- Week 2
  1. Develop a simple level with platforms and obstacles
  2. Add a scoring system with collectibles and display the score on the screen

- Week N (Final)
  1. Polish graphics and implement sound effects
  2. Test and refine the gameplay mechanics, and prepare for deployment on GitHub
